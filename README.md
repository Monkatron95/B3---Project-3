# B3---Project-3

Welcome to our third project. This program has been created using pygame.

The purpose of the project was to create a program in which a robot is to collect treasure of different scores.
the score is saved and displayed. The user can use the buttons under 'add treasure' to randomly generate trasure.

Treasure can be moved by clicking and dragging.

Once the timer has completed, the user is requested to choose a sorting algorithm to sort the treasures.
