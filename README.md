# B3---Project-3

Welcome to our third project. This program has been created using pygame.

The purpose of the project was to create a program in which a robot is to collect treasure of different scores.
the score is saved and displayed. The user can use the buttons under 'add treasure' to randomly generate trasure.
The robot also follows a traffic light system to whether or not it can move around to find treasure.

Treasure can be moved by clicking and dragging.

Once the timer has completed, the user is requested to choose a sorting algorithm to sort the treasures. There are 3 types of treasure in the project, bronze, silver and gold. The sorting algorithms of choice are:
Bubble Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Insertion Sort
Selection Sort

You can also control the music of the game with the menu on the right hand side of the screen, using the play, pause, previous and next buttons.
